            <h1>Amazing Article</h1>
            <small>James Clear</small>
            <p>In this article, I’d like to share 30 “one-sentence stories” about building better habits. (They are not
                all exactly one sentence, but they are very short.)

                None of these stories are mine. They were sent to me by readers of Atomic Habits. My hope is that these
                examples will illustrate how real people are putting the book into practice. They will show you what
                people are actually doing to build good habits and break bad ones. And hopefully, they will spark some
                ideas for how you can do the same.

                I have divided the stories into categories that roughly correspond to different sections or ideas in the
                book.</p>
            <h3>30 One-Sentence Stories From People Who Have Built Better Habits</h3>

            <p>ne of the central ideas in the book is the concept of building “identity-based habits”, which essentially
                recommends focusing on the type of person you wish to become rather than the outcome you wish to
                achieve.

                One reader named Roland used the idea to improve his eating habits.

                “I stopped eating unhealthy food via identity change,” he wrote. “I tried many times in the past, but it
                became easy — natural — only after I had made the conscious decision that I want to be someone who eats
                healthy. Instead of aiming for I want to stop eating bad food, I tried changing the mindset to I am
                someone that eats healthy and lives a healthy life. It changes how you approach things.”</p>
